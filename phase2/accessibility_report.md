## Principles of Universal Design

### Equitable Use

* We have paid a lot of attention to how our app's design looks so we can make it appealing to all users.
* In our app, we have two types of users: Manager and Customer. The only difference between the two types is whether or not they are able to add a hotel listing. 
* Our app is currently only offered in English. In the future, support for multiple languages could be implemented easily thanks to our use of string resources.
* UI elements, including images, have underlying content descriptions which provides information to Android accessibility services, particularly text to speech services.
* UI element positions are defined using keywords agnostic towards left or right locales such as "start" or "end".

### Flexibility in Use

* Our app does not impose any restrictions on the user's pace.
* We are working on implementing a dark mode for our GUI.
* Our app should be able to be used by both left- and right-handed users. 

### Simple and Intuitive Use

* All instructions when accessing app features, such as registering as a user, use simple vocabulary and are as straightforward as possible.
* All users should be able to use our app despite their skill level. 
* Related functions are grouped together within the user interface creating an intuitive workflow.
* Where possible, we limit inputs through the keyboard to the specific type that would be accepted, making it more intutive as to what the app expects from the user.

### Perceptible Information

* Our app has a simple, minimalistic design with only essential data displayed. Most of the information is shown as text and cues are not solely reliant on colors. 
* The text is easy to read as it is in a legible font and has a distinct contrast against the background.
* Individual UI elements like text boxes are large and have a high contrast compared to the background, making them stand out.

### Tolerance for Error

* Our app generates helpful error messages when the user gives it invalid inputs. For example, when a user is registering an account and does not choose a strong enough password, the error message that pops up tells them.
* Our app also allows for error recovery. Furthering the example made earlier, the message would include instructions for a stronger password so the user is able to recognise the error and recover from it.

### Low Physical Effort

* A user does not need to use much physical effort to use our app, other than having to type in inputs to register as a new user or list a hotel.
* We have used the Google Places AutoComplete Feature so the user does not have have to type in the entire location of their destination when searching for a hotel. 

### Size and Space for Approach and Use

* This principle is not very applicable to our app as all its features can be done on the screen of a phone. So, there is no real requirement for physical space.
* As long as the user has an area where they can use their device, they should be able to use our app.
* App interface elements scale with the user's screen size, resolution, and ascpect ratio, ensuring screen space utilization is maximized such that the app is agnostic towards the user's display specifications.

## Marketing the program

Our app is marketable to anyone that is looking for nearby hotels. This covers a wide range of individuals - business travellers, event/conference attendees, families, tour groups, solo tourists, and more. Our app is also marketable to any hotel manager/owner that is looking for a platform to list their available hotel rooms. Our app must be marketable to both types of users as they depend on each other; hotel managers would only use our app if it can generate enough interest from customers, and customers would only use our app if there are hotel listings.

## Program usage by other demographics

The main demographic of people that are less likely to use our app are those who do not travel or do not work as a hotel manager/owner. For those that manage/own hotels, they would be less likely to use our app if they do not have access to a digital device at their workplace. If a hotel's management has not converted its administration to a more digital system, they would be unable to have access to our app.
