Specification:

Create an android application that filters hotels by factors such as price range, address, and 
amenities to facilitate bookings. Each hotel is associated with a list of rooms. Each room is 
associated with a capacity (max number of guests it can accommodate), price, amenities, schedule 
(dates on which it is available for booking), and beds (which vary based on size and number).
Users can be managers or customers. If the user is a customer, they should be able to get a list 
of available rooms that fit their criteria, and book rooms. Managers can add their hotel to the 
database, create rooms, and get information about rooms in their hotel.
