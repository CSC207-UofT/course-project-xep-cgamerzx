### Specification:
Create an android application that allows a user to filter hotels by factors such as price range, address, and amenities to facilitate bookings. Each hotel is associated with a list of rooms. Each room is associated with a capacity, price, amenities, schedule, and beds. Beds are stored in a way such that multiple types can be associated with a room, with a different quantity count per type. Rooms also reference the hotel they belong to.

Users of the application can be classified as either management or customers. If the user is a customer, they should be able to get a list of available rooms that fit their criteria, and book rooms or, obtain information on how to book rooms. Criteria factors can be anything from location, room characteristics, to schedule. Management users can add their hotel to the database, create rooms, and get information about rooms in their hotel. Management has control over all characteristics of the hotel and rooms they are creating. This includes hotel location, room pricing, room availability periods, the kinds of beds associated with each room and more. Data is saved in a persistent manner such that even after closing the app, any data created or modified prior is capable of being loaded and utilized.
