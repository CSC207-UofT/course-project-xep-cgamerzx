Create an android application that allows a user to filter hotels by factors such as price range, address, and amenities to facilitate bookings. Each hotel is associated with a list of rooms. Each room is associated with a capacity, price, amenities, schedule , and beds. 
Users can be managers or customers. If the user is a customer, they should be able to get a list of available rooms that fit their criteria, and book rooms. Managers can add their hotel to the database, create rooms, and get information about rooms in their hotel.
